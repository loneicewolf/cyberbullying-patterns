This document is where I start breaking down experiences I’ve lived through into
`generalized and clear concepts and patterns`.

Again, no real names will be mentioned. Only generalized behaviours.
For example: what it means when someone behaves “normal,” “neutral,” or even kind,
and then that behaviour suddenly shifts the moment they don’t get what they want.

I want to make something clear from the start:
It’s very easy to picture bullies as simply “evil.” I understand why people feel that way.
Especially the first time someone experiences bullying, negative feelings toward that person
are completely natural.

But the way I personally live my life (only speaking for myself) is that I try to see a bigger picture:
many people suffer silently. Stress, fear, anger, insecurity, emotional instability — these things stack.
Sometimes a small, “not positive but not negative either” moment triggers a snap, not because the
target did anything objectively wrong, but because the person (the “bully”) was already unstable.

**IMPORTANT:**  
This explains behaviour, but it does **not** excuse it.  
I’m fully against bullying, manipulation, slander, and all forms of harassment.
Hurting others never becomes okay just because someone else feels bad.

This document tries to explain the “why,” not justify anything.  
Explanation is *not* the same as excusing behaviour.

# Questions I ask myself when analyzing patterns

1. Why do people bully others in the first place? What do they gain from it?
2. Are they taking out existing stress or anger that wasn’t originally about you?
3. Does bullying actually make them feel “better”? If so, why — and in what way?
4. Why do some people react negatively even when you try to de-escalate?

Examples of patterns I’ve personally observed (generalized):

- Someone becomes upset about something unrelated to you, and suddenly you’re a target too.
- You block someone to de-escalate, but they continue through indirect channels.
- They can’t accept being blocked, so they try to engage again — sometimes through smearing,
  slander, or vagueposting to paint themselves as the victim.
- They might claim publicly: “Now you will block me and tell others I harassed you.”
  This is a manipulation tactic that serves two purposes:
    - If you block them (**which you should, for safety**), they say you “did exactly what they predicted.”
    - If you don’t, they keep you trapped in the loop.
    - If you report them, same thing — they treat it as “proof.”
  This feels disturbing because it looks like they’re “predicting your behaviour,” but really,
  it’s a manipulation strategy. A dirty trick.

This pattern overlaps with:
- **DARVO** (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender)
- **Guilt tripping**
- **Moving goalposts**
- **Strawman distortions**

These tactics make you feel like whatever you do is “wrong,” even when you’re simply setting boundaries.

Blocking is healthy and necessary in these situations.
It breaks the cycle. It shows you’re done engaging.
The severity of the situation matters, but in my case it was severe enough that
the person repeatedly tried to frame me as “oversensitive” publicly even after I moved on.
Thankfully, I had friends who helped shut it down. This was years ago now.

# The point of writing this isn’t to revisit personal events — it’s to map out the patterns so  others can recognize them and protect themselves early.
