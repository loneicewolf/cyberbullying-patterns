This document is where I start breaking down experiences I’ve lived through into
`generalized and clear concepts and patterns`.

Again, no real names will be mentioned. Only generalized behaviours.
For example: what it means when someone behaves “normal,” “neutral,” or even kind,
and then that behaviour suddenly shifts the moment they don’t get what they want.

I want to make something clear from the start:
It’s very easy to picture bullies as simply “evil.” I understand why people feel that way.
Especially the first time someone experiences bullying, negative feelings toward that person
are completely natural.

## Part 1

But the way I personally live my life (only speaking for myself) is that I try to see a bigger picture:
many people suffer silently. Stress, fear, anger, insecurity, emotional instability — these things stack.
Sometimes a small, “not positive but not negative either” moment triggers a snap, not because the
target did anything objectively wrong, but because the person (the “bully”) was already unstable.

**IMPORTANT:**  
This explains behaviour, but it does **not** excuse it.  
I’m fully against bullying, manipulation, slander, and all forms of harassment.
Hurting others never becomes okay just because someone else feels bad.

This document tries to explain the “why,” not justify anything.  
Explanation is *not* the same as excusing behaviour.

# Questions I ask myself when analyzing patterns

1. Why do people bully others in the first place? What do they gain from it?
2. Are they taking out existing stress or anger that wasn’t originally about you?
3. Does bullying actually make them feel “better”? If so, why — and in what way?
4. Why do some people react negatively even when you try to de-escalate?

Examples of patterns I’ve personally observed (generalized):

- Someone becomes upset about something unrelated to you, and suddenly you’re a target too.
- You block someone to de-escalate, but they continue through indirect channels.
- They can’t accept being blocked, so they try to engage again — sometimes through smearing,
  slander, or vagueposting to paint themselves as the victim.
- They might claim publicly: “Now you will block me and tell others I harassed you.”
  This is a manipulation tactic that serves two purposes:
    - If you block them (**which you should, for safety**), they say you “did exactly what they predicted.”
    - If you don’t, they keep you trapped in the loop.
    - If you report them, same thing — they treat it as “proof.”
  This feels disturbing because it looks like they’re “predicting your behaviour,” but really,
  it’s a manipulation strategy. A dirty trick.

This pattern overlaps with:
- **DARVO** (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender)
- **Guilt tripping**
- **Moving goalposts**
- **Strawman distortions**

These tactics make you feel like whatever you do is “wrong,” even when you’re simply setting boundaries.

Blocking is healthy and necessary in these situations.
It breaks the cycle. It shows you’re done engaging.
The severity of the situation matters, but in my case it was severe enough that
the person repeatedly tried to frame me as “oversensitive” publicly even after I moved on.
Thankfully, I had friends who helped shut it down.

> This was years ago now.

## Part 2
This is a more recent experience - TLDR: They apologized, and I accepted their apology, and still have them blocked because trust, isn't easily just "switched on" when you've been the target in a smearing/slander campaign. 
I don't even know if they stopped, i just, hope they have, (e.g i havent had any more people asking me about it, but yaeh it was quite disturbing when it happened)

This person, im about to explain, was similar to the other person i talked about above:
**NOTE**: this person has apologized, and, I accepted their apology but keeping the block on and I hope it has stopped

## PATTERN:"kind first, and then just blow up"
it was the same pattern: kind and then blow up about something so small.

When I decided id just leave a server to, step back a bit
..that was appearently un-acceptable for this person.
they Begun to smear my name, to others
and I got people DM'ing me to ask 
- "is this true?"
- "this person said you annoyed person X and you was mean to person Y, is this true?"
- one even said "i dont trust this person, can i hear your story?"

And what I did here was, I stayed calm and gave the objective-truth, (basically factually what actually had happened) (**objectively** instead of **emotionally**) Because, *it's easy to let the emotions spill out, when someone paints you as the bad one*  (*DARVO*), however severe it is, cuz you want to defend yourself. 

### The Reporting Part
> Now, I knew, since this will be stuff I might even show **some Authority** 
> (**Yes. It was that severe** And it's not the first time I reported someone this way)
cuz yelling back to the bully won't help, it will basically also lower myself to the same level as the bully. 
So I shared, to everyone who asked me for "my side"/"my story", I gave the **exact same thing**, (Objectively what happened, factually, the same to everyone) < consistency

Because bullies will try to twist stories into their favor 
(this **will be a very easy thing to spot, cuz they might say 1 thing to another, another thing, to yet another, etc*) 
and, in this scenario the "things" the bully had said was not at all objective wrong doings on my part, it was only emotional statements:
- They used fallacies (Guilt Tripping, Moving goalposts, Strawmanning, bringing up old problems already solved<not a fallacy but)
- Nothing was actually pointed out to be "objectively wrong" it was *just* "You're a bad person" and "is this how you thank me" and stuff;

# Now, again this person has apologized 
And said sorry for the lies they told others about me - which - when that happened - **it moved me to tears**, 
because I had tried to understand why did they even do all this?  Now **I still have both persons** blocked (I've accepted the apology of course but trust isn't a switch, especially when it's been about smearing and, stuff),

## What I learned from this experience:
> Stay calm, and do not meet their "yelling" of how "wrong you are", and if smearing happens, give the truth to people, simple as that, dont write or do anything when you're emotional (when i cried one time, I headed out to the woods and yeah, I came home with a clearer head) < it really helps a lot!

# The point of writing this isn’t to revisit personal events — it’s to map out the patterns so  others can recognize them and protect themselves early.

### Now, even If i linked resources before, 
### here it is again cuz you cant stress this enough:
> **Personal Note**  🫂 hugs to you all!
> and, if i can say a word to you who reads this: If you have been bullied or, been treated badly, i send u a virtual hug, really, do take care
