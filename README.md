# Cyber Bullying Patterns
## To SS (SPOT and STOP) bullying
I created this repo cuz i wanted to take things ive gone trough online & turn them into something useful for others - without drama, this will only be like, patterns, general stuff, names of patterns, and knowledge. Note this is by no means complete, im just writing what *ive myself experienced* so, yeah!

since im recovering from concussion still (week 3 while writing this) i will keep things simple:
i will name patterns
explain concepts
and sharing resources(IC3,etc)

# ⚠️ disclaimer
this is a heavy topic, of course, and  i want to make it clear,
- i wont include any actual, like names or people or yeah,
- i will only describe the **behaviour**, and **generalized stuff** (experience -> generalized into patterns/names/concepts -> and then dive deep into examples like e.g DARVO/fallacies/guilt tripping etc)
- i might write/draw diagrams, and explain 

`============================================================`

🫂 First Of All, most importantly, Resources!
> **Personal Note** 
> and, if i can say a word to you who reads this: If you have been bullied or, been treated badly, i send u a virtual hug, really, do take care
